# Ipafair-sys

IPAFAIR is an incremental API for argumentation framework (AF) solvers.
It mimics the IPASIR interface for SAT incremental solvers, but is dedicated to dynamics in argumentation frameworks.
The IPASIR project can be found [on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group/ipafair/src/master/).

This project provides Rust bindings for the IPAFAIR API.
